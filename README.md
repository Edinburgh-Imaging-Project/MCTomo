## Requirements

* A C compiler that supports C++11 and a Fortran compiler which supports Fortran 2003.

* CGAL 4.8 or later ( for 3d delaunay and Voronoi support) CGAL can be downloaded from (http://www.cgal.org/) and can be built and installed following [CGAL installation manual] (http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html). 

If you are using MAC OS X, CGAL can be installed by following way:
     
     sudo port install cgal
  
  On debian/Ubuntu, 
     
     sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev

* NetCDF4 or later ( support for storaging the samples in a protable way ). If you do not have a netcdf4 library, you can install it through a package management program, such as rpm, yum, homebrew, macports, adept, and others.  Alternatively, you can download it from (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html).
  This is not necessary. If you do not want to use netcdf4 library, just leave the NETCDF variable undefined in the makefile.

## Algorithms and Dependencies

**Normal Modes**

* The surface wave modal approximation code is from COMPUTER PROGRAM IN SEISMOLOGY wrote by Herrmann, R.B. (http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqccps.html).

**Fast Marching**

* The code used the fast marching method to calculate the first arrival times. The 2D fast marching code is from Nick Rawlinson (http://rses.anu.edu.au/seismology/soft/fmmcode/). For the 3D body wave tomography, we used a general N-dimensional fast marching code by Gomez, J.V. and Pardeiro, J. (https://github.com/jvgomez/fast_methods). Both of them are revised for our usage.

**3D Voronoi**

* The 3D Voronoi tessellation is calculated based on CGAL (see above). However, we still used the KD-tree method to convert the Voronoi diagram to a regular grid based representation (https://github.com/jmhodges/kdtree2).

## Compilation

* Add your cgal include path (e.g. MYCGAL/include) and link path in the *src/makefile*
* If available and necessary, add your netcdf include path and link path in the *src/makefile*
* Then in the src directory

      make
